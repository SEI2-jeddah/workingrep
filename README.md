 =========

git save and keep track of the changes we make in our files buy creating a repository directory 

first we need to initialize .git repository directory 
git init
git --version => the version of git
git add . => add changes 
git commit -m  "descritve message" => commit the changes 

we can connect our local repository directory  to GitHub using
=> git remote https://GitHub.com
then add and comment and push 

=========
GitHub remote repository directory 
after we create account 
we can start a new repository or fork we can pull from forked repository
=> git pull  https://GitHub.com
clone the repository link => git clone https://GitHub.com
to create a local repository 
edit it 
add and commit 
push it => push origin master
submit and pull request in GitHub website
